# Plottools
### Description
A Python package containing tools for plotting data stored in .csv files.

### Installation
Clone this repository, navigate its root and run
`$ pip install . --user`
for user installation. If pip warns you that the scripts have been installed in a folder that is not on PATH or the scripts are not found when you try to run them from the command line, you will need to update PATH by adding to it the path in which the scripts are installed. If you are on a Unix system, you can do this by pasting the line `export PATH="/path/to/install/dir:$PATH"` on your .bashrc file.
Remember to change /path/to/install/dir with the path at which the scripts have actually been installed.
